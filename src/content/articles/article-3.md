The Park Squirrel Strike has reached its 20th day, with no resolution in sight as negotiations between the union and park officials continue. The strike, initiated over demands for better working conditions and increased nut rations, has left visitors without the usual spectacle of mischievous squirrels stealing fries and posing for impromptu photos.

“It’s not just about the food—it’s about respect,” said union representative Nutty McTail. “We’re standing up for our rights, one acorn at a time.” Visitors have expressed mixed feelings, with some missing the quirky interactions while others enjoy their meals uninterrupted.
