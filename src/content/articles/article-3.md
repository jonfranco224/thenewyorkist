After building a substantial case of copyright infringement, Apple has taken a monumental step in the history of property ownership laws by suing Apple over the design, hardware, and software of the iPhone 5.

“Speaking bluntly, the developers at Apple clearly plagiarized Apple’s groundbreaking design, with only minor modifications,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook during a legal proceeding for the case of Apple vs. Apple. ”It’s appalling that Apple thought they could get away with this.”

The recent litigation by Apple Inc. has spawned a far reaching investigation of patents for other technologies, all of which are claimed to be owned by Apple as well as Apple.

“It’s impossible that Apple filed these patents at the exact same moment and with the same choice of words as Apple,” stated journalist Thomas Friedman in the New York Times article “Why Apple Needs to Fight Apple”, “I assume that either foul play has occurred or we are witnessing an unintended bureaucratic nightmare.”

Apple CEO Tim Cook has responded to the numerous patent infringement claims by stating that “Apple’s research and development is entirely internal, and that any likeness of Apple products to Apple products is entirely coincidental.”

In response to Tim Cook’s released statements, Tim Cook castigated Tim Cook for “blatantly disregarding the evils of his persuasive powers” and “coming up with such a shitty maps software.”
