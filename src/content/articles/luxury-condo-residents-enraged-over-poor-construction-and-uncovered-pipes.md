In the Upper East Side, residents of a luxury condo building are up in arms after discovering wiring, pipes, and piles of dust behind their apartment walls.

“I couldn’t believe it,” said Amy Tucker, VP of a prominent banking company. “I don’t pay the money I do to have so much dirt behind my walls. Why not just have the staff clean it up? And what are these exposed metal pipes? I live in the Upper East Side, not Bushwick.”

After the discovery, Amy went straight to management to complain but received very little reconciliation in return.

“All I got was a bunch of excuses. ‘Amy, those wires power your home,’ and ‘Amy, don’t touch those pipes; they run water through the building.’ How typical of a management company to go on the defensive when one of their residents exposes their shortcomings,” she told us in an interview.

After an unsuccessful phone call with management, Amy decided to form a coalition and see if she could pull the residents together to form a class action lawsuit.

We reached out to the management company, but they declined to comment.
