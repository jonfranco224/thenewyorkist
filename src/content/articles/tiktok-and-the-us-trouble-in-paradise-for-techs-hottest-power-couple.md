The digital world’s most dramatic "it couple," TikTok and the United States, is at it again, leaving everyone asking: are they done for good, or is there still hope for this messy relationship?

Last night, the drama hit an all-time high when the U.S. gave TikTok a savage ultimatum: “Prove you’re trustworthy, or we’re done.” And in true TikTok fashion, the app didn’t hold back, responding with a shocking breakup announcement. But hold onto your ring lights—this morning, the couple made a jaw-dropping revelation: they’re back together! And get this—they’ve agreed to “therapy” for the next 90 days to “work on trust issues.”

The on-again, off-again saga has left fans caught in the crossfire. “I just really can't lose my recipe videos over this, you know,” said one user.

Insiders who know the couple closely report that the government insists it’s just trying to keep things safe. In an interview, the U.S. told fans, “It’s like, we love TikTok, but we can’t trust it right now. Like, who are you texting? What are you doing? It’s shady, and we deserve better.” Cue TikTok’s teary defense, claiming it’s done everything to prove its loyalty. “Ugh, we’re literally not spying on anyone!” the app clapped back in a public statement.

Meanwhile, fans are spiraling at the thought of a breakup. “If they break up, like, what am I even supposed to do with my life?” said a visibly distressed influencer. “Follow Reels? Ew.” Another TikTok creator chimed in: “I simply do not claim this kind of toxic energy.”
