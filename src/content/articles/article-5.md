The benefits of marijuana have been well documented for the past decade. Treatment with marijuana can promote reduced strain in ocular and other motor movements for those suffering with glaucoma and arthritis as well as increased appetite for those being treated with chemotherapy. The latest and perhaps most shocking wave of research comes now from the heart of the UCF branch of NORML, which revealed its startling new find this weekend.

NORML scientist Dr. Alberto Abrego comments,“Essentially, the same chemical production that relieves body pain and stimulates appetite could also initiate a psychological state in which not only is life funnier and more enjoyable, but everything is just pretty chill.” He continued, “Really it is very much like being high.”

When asked about the potential uses of such a discovery, Dr. Abrego responded with confidence, “I think smoking helps you relax, yes. I guess if we all smoked we’d probably, you know, be a lot chiller.”

This find could be a long awaited for breakthrough in multiple fields of research, as interdisciplinary studies major Barry Coalman points out.

“There is already work being done here in the Biology Department about how high dogs can get or if turtles can get high. And I know some of the guys in the Music Department get pretty high, too.”

When asked for comment, SGA President Kilbride responded “I don’t know [fit of laughter], man, I don’t know. All I do know, I mean, what I do know is that [sobbing] I just love everything so much, and sometimes…” The interview was disrupted by President Kilbride’s apparent shock and subsequent investigation of “the most amazing tree.”
