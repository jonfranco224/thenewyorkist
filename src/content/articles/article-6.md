At Barnes & Noble’s NOOK event earlier today, CEO WIlliam Lynch introduced the latest edition to their growing family of eReaders, the Nook Book. “The Nook Book is going to revolutionize the way we read books,” Lynch kicked off the event, “With 1035 individual E ink screens, the Nook Book provides for the most book-like digital reading experience imaginable.”

Deviating from the cumbersome online bookstore model of most current eReaders, the customer will have to decide which book their Nook Book will be displaying before they make their purchase, because the hot new device is only capable of storing and displaying a single book.

Lynch continued, “With a pixel density of over 1000 ppi, the screens are such a high resolution that even a microscope would fail to distinguish individual pixels. They don’t just look like paper, they feel like paper. You can even fold them, draw on them, and tear them. It’s the most advanced E ink screen technology in development, years ahead of the competition.”

According to the press release, the book reading experience is so accurate that if you want your Nook Book to display a different title, you’re going to have to purchase an entirely new device.

Sporting a 7 pound chassis that’s only 4 inches thick, and boasting an astounding battery life of approximately 85 years on a single charge, the Nook Book could be the first true Kindle killer when it hits the shelves on June 10th.
