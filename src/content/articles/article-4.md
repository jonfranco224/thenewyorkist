As expected, UCF’s 19th annual Race for the Cure didn’t fail to bring the excitement and spirit it brings every year. Students, faculty, and people from all walks of Orlando came down to Memory Mall to witness the race of a lifetime.

The patients ran their hearts out at the sound of the gunshot to get to the single vial of pancreatic cancer cure at the end of the finish line. And boy, was this race a close one.

Races are usually won by 15 to 20 feet, with several runners dying midway through, but nobody died this year. The determination in the runners’ eyes was astounding, the twinkle was blinding.

“I’ve never seen anything like it before in my life,” exclaimed physics major Jeremy Piston.

Judge Ron Castleberry felt similarly: “If all races were run with just half as much passion as was evident here today, we’d all live in a far more developed society. The good-hearted competitiveness, and the tears in the runners’ eyes as they ran for the cure actually made me cry. I’ve never cried at a race before. It was beautiful.”

All of that courage and fortitude did, however, momentarily disappear as several of the runners attacked the winner, Andy Martin, screaming something about ‘needing the cure’ and ‘not wanting to die.’ Andy quickly drank the whole vial and danced around bellowing about how great he felt.

“They’re just sore losers,” Andy told our correspondent.

But the amity and benevolence quickly returned after the UCF Police beat and escorted the unruly patients off the field.

“It was a good race, but in the end I think I let my wife and family down,” Al Stark said, after placing second in the race. “Hopefully I’ll still be around to compete in next year’s race.”
