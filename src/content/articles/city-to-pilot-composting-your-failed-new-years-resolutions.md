In an effort to both reduce waste and harness unused energy, the city is launching a pilot program allowing residents to "compost" their failed New Year's resolutions. The initiative, starting next month, encourages citizens to anonymously send in their abandoned goals, which will be processed for future city projects.

"We know how tough it can be to stick to resolutions," said Mayor Jane Roberts. "This program offers a way for people to turn their unkept promises into something beneficial for the community." The city hopes the new project will reduce waste while creating new energy solutions.

A key feature of the program is that the emotional "hot gas" produced from the burnout of these resolutions will be captured and converted back into usable energy, feeding into the city's grid to power next year’s initiatives. "It's all about turning negative energy into something positive," said program coordinator Amy Tran.

Some residents have already expressed their support. "I’m happy to finally let go of my resolution to hit the gym every day," shared local resident Mark Henson. "It's nice knowing it can help the city while I head over to my local bagel spot."

The initiative reflects the city's innovative approach to sustainability and resourcefulness. "Even in our failures, there’s a chance to give back," said Roberts, as the city prepares for its first round of composting resolutions.
